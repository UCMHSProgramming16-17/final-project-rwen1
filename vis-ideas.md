Ideas:
* 1. graph weather over time in a particular region
* 2. write a program to graph best Pokemon to use in a particular encounter
* 3. graph a visual representation of the Pokedex (Pokemon dictionary)

I chose idea #3 because it was the most interesting


January 22, 2017:
* Created program in "assignments" workspace called "pokemonAPIReference.py"
* Downloaded "Pokemon.csv" from Kaggle
* Wrote imports and basic data reading functions

January 23, 2017:
* Plotted points using Scatter based on Pokedex number and total stat value
* Had trouble displaying data with HoverTool

January 24, 2017:
* Changed from using Scatter() to using figure()
* Successfully displayed data with HoverTool
* Created program called "getPokeInfo.py" to call information from PokeAPI and write it in local file "pokeSprites.csv"

January 25, 2017:
* Added colors to plotted points
* Added more features to displayed data
* Moved project to final-project folder in "practice exercises" workspace and renamed main program to "pokedex.py"
